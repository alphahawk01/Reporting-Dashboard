/**
 * "PREMIER DATA" is a placeholder name recorded in deputy_shifts and
 * TT_Games when a shift or game was jointly handled by multiple analysts
 * rather than a single individual. It is not a real analyst and must be
 * excluded from every page that ranks, scores, lists, or attributes work
 * to analysts (Leaderboard, Analyst Profile, Analyst Compare,
 * Recommendations, Reporting).
 *
 * Matching is case/whitespace insensitive so variants like "Premier Data",
 * "premier  data" or trailing spaces are all caught.
